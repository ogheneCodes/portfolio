              ONLINE TEST AND EXAM TAKING APPLICATION
            </Text>
            <Text as="p">
              Testing students using only the multiple choice question type in
              Computer Based Testing is not the efficient method because it
              breeds more room for guess work. I now came up with a solution by
              building a CBT app that offers a two range of question types which
              are Free Text Area (fill in the blanks) and muiltiple choice
              question type.

            <Text mb="6">
              This app enables the examiner to set questions that can include
              both multiple choice and free text area question type.
